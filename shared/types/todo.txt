Types that lacks helpers currently, that should preferably be implemented:
- T2DPointArray
- T2DIntArray
- T2DExtendedArray

Note (march 2016):
1. Keep up compatibility with current official release of Simba.
   Sadly that means we can't use some of the nicer features of newer Lape

2. We should get all functions documented, even a very simple focumentation does the trick
   Just so that people have something to refer to.
   
   Currently docs are not hosted online, but we'll get there.
