Contributing
-------------
Some basic guidelines if you feel like contributing to this project:

- Readability is important.  
- Keep up the current programming style.
- No need for many ways to do the same thing.
- Fast code is nice, but if it notably reduces readability it's probably not worth it.
- Test your code, make sure it really works. If it has limitations tell us about em.
- The include is not supposed to do all the work.
- All contributions are appreciated, accepted or not.
